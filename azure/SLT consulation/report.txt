At SLT Consulting, we focus on transforming learning and development (L&D) organizations into data-driven teams that leverage new technologies to enhance personal and organizational growth. We aim to showcase the added value of L&D through technology and data.

Key Contributions and Responsibilities:

Data Architecture and Design:
Segregated data into dimension (dim) and fact tables, creating an Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram to illustrate the data model.
Developed a hybrid schema by incorporating dimension and fact tables based on project requirements.

Data Preparation and Testing:
Created dummy data during the development phase to test the product thoroughly before onboarding actual clients.

Data Integration and ETL Processes:
Managed data integration using Azure Data Factory (ADF) pipelines.
Uploaded source CSV files to Azure Blob Storage and designed ADF pipelines to transfer data to SQL Server.

Reporting and Visualization:
Collaborated with the Power BI team to generate reports based on the transformed and loaded data in SQL Server, ensuring data accuracy and relevance for reporting needs.

Automation and Monitoring:
Implemented event-based triggers in ADF to automate pipeline executions upon file uploads.
Used lookup activities within pipelines to capture and manage pipeline details, utilizing a flag (0 or 1) to control pipeline execution (based on SQL query where isActive = 1).

Pipeline Management:
Designed and managed three key pipelines:
Master Pipeline: Coordinated the overall ETL process.
Source File Extract Data Load: Handled the extraction and initial loading of data from source files.
Destination Table Load: Managed the final loading of transformed data into destination tables.

Project Impact:
Successfully transformed the data architecture to support L&D initiatives, improving the ability to analyze and report on key metrics.
Enhanced data reliability and performance through the use of dimension and fact tables.
Streamlined data workflows and automation, leading to more efficient data processing and reduced manual intervention.
Provided valuable insights through Power BI reports, aiding in informed decision-making and demonstrating the added value of L&D initiatives.

Personal Role:
As a Data Engineer, I played a crucial role in designing the data architecture, developing ETL pipelines, and ensuring the seamless integration of data across various platforms.
I collaborated closely with cross-functional teams, including data analysts and the Power BI team, to deliver comprehensive data solutions that meet business needs.
My efforts in automating and monitoring data processes ensured high data quality and consistency, contributing to the overall success of the project.
